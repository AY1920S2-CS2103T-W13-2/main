== PROJECT: Morpheus

== Overview

Morpheus is a desktop application that aims to facilitate the administrative work of hotel services as a hotel room management system. The system will also provide statistics and reports, constructed from the analysis of the details in the user-provided database. Most of the user interaction occurs via a CLI (Command Line Interface).

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement #1*: implemented *check-in/check-out command*
** What it does: This allows the user to check-in or check-out guest into the hotel.
** Justification: It enables the user to keep track of which room is empty and which room is occupied.
** Highlights: This enhancement is quite challenging since it is created in the early period which needs more planning.

* *Major enhancement #2*: implemented *extend command*
** What it does: This allows the user to extend the stay of guest.
** Justification: Guest could probably extend stay if they wanted to. Without creating the bill for the previous stay, extend command allows it to be combined in the same bill.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added booking ID implementation.
