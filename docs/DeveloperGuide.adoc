== Introduction

=== Product Description

Morpheus is a desktop application that aims to facilitate the administrative work of hotel services as a hotel room management system.
The system will also provide statistics and reports, constructed from the analysis of the details in the user-provided database.
Most of the user interaction occurs via a CLI (Command Line Interface).

=== Purpose

This document describes the architecture and software design of Morpheus.
The intended audience is the developers, designers and software testers who wish to understand, maintain & upgrade the desktop application.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::OverallArchitecture.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.

*Morpheus* closely follows the **Command Pattern ** design of software. +
This is a quick representation of how the Command Pattern works: +
_Client -> Invoker -> CommandQueue -> ExecuteCommand_

In this case, the client is the application which creates and adds a command object to the invoker.
The invoker then executes the command objects.
//end::Architecture[]

Given below is a quick overview of the components in the architecture of the software.

<<Design-Main,*`Main`*>> has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

<<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.

* Presents App data in a GUI.
* Receives commands from the user.

<<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.

* Parses the commands entered by user.
* Adds command objects to command queue.

<<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.

* Executes actions indicated by commands on the data in-memory.

<<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows an overview how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteroom`.

.Component interactions for `deleteroom` command
image::ArchitectureComponentDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]

//tag::UiCompJohnny[]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `RoomListPanel`, `PersonListPanel`, `WelcomePanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

* Receive command result to change view accordingly.

Below is diagram for how UI extract command result for changing view.

//end::UiCompJohnny[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a room).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteroom")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteroom` Command
image::LogicSequenceDiagram.png[]


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores the Hotel data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` ,  `ObservableList<Room>` , `ObservableList<Booking>` , `ObservableList<AvailableService>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes Hotel's data.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.
* can save Hotel data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Hotel Initialization
The following steps show how to set up a hotel:

==== AddGuestCommand
===== Implementation
This command adds a guest into the hotel using their name, guest ID, phone and email.

The following steps show how the add guest feature works:

1. The `addguest` command entered by the user is parsed and the different fields are tokenized.

2. The command is then executed by creating a new Guest object using the fields entered and adding the guest object into the Hotel.

==== AddRoomCommand
===== Implementation
This command adds a room into the hotel using the room number, tier and the cost of the room.

The following steps show how the add room feature works:

1. The `addroom` command entered by the user is parsed and the different fields are tokenized.

2. A new room object is created using the tokenized arguments and it is added into the hotel.

[[Initialization-AddService]]
==== AddService Command
===== Implementation

The following steps show how the AddService command is implemented:

1.  The command from user is parsed and undergoes checks for the validity of the `SERVICE_ID`, `COST` and `DESCRIPTION`.
2.  If the parameters are valid, `AddServiceCommand#execute(Model model)` is invoked, which checks if the service id exists.
3.  If the service id does not exist, a `AvailableService` object is created and `Model#add(AvailableService service) is called to add an available service to hotel.


=== Search feature

//tag::findguest[]
==== FindGuestCommand
===== Implementation
Currently this command only support searching for full name or/and id number.

The following steps show how the search guest feature works:

1.  The search command from the user is parsed into a list of pattern contained in the search command.

2.  The command then executes and filters the guest list based on the patterns.

The diagram below show how the search command store its pattern.

.Class diagram for FindGuestCommand
image::FindGuestCommand.png[]

The diagram below shows the execution of the command:

.Activity Diagram of Search Feature
image::SearchWorkflow.png[]

===== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store pattern as list of name and id.
** Pros: Simpler to test and understand.
** Cons: Difficult to extend the implementation.
* **Alternative 2:** Store pattern as a combination of Predicate.
** Pros: Easy to implement and add more complicated pattern.
** Cons: Harder to test, more prone to error.
//end::findguest[]

=== Billing System

The billing system is designed to aid hotel receptionists in their bookkeeping and consists of the following operations:

* `SetRoomCostCommand` -- Sets the cost of a room.
* `AddServiceCommand` -- Creates a chargeable service.
* `ChargeServiceCommand` -- Charges a guest for a requested service.
* `RemoveChargedServiceCommand` -- Removes a charged service from the bill of a guest.
* `FetchBillCommand` -- Fetches the bill of a guest, including the cost of the room.

The following activity diagram summarizes the usage of the billing feature:

.Activity Diagram of Billing System
image::BillingActivityDiagram.png[]

==== SetRoomCost Command

This section goes through the implementation and design considerations of the SetRoomCost command.

===== Implementation

The following steps show how the command is implemented:

1.  The command from the user is parsed and undergoes checks for the validity of the given `ROOMNUMBER` and `COST`.
2.  If the parameters are valid, `SetRoomCostCommand#execute(Model model)` is invoked, which checks if the given room exists.
3.  If the room exists, a `RoomCost` object is created and `Model#setRoomCost(Room room, RoomCost roomCost)` is called to set the cost of the room by setting the 'roomCost' attribute of the `Room` object.

The sequence diagram below shoes how the SetRoomCost command works:

.Sequence Diagram of SetRooomCost Command
image::SetRoomCostSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

Below describes ideas that were considered when designing the command.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the cost of the room as an attribute in the `Room` object.
** Pros: Application of OOP concepts.
** Cons: Requires a deeper understanding of the Logic & Model components in order to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the costs of rooms in a separate list (e.g. as a HashMap) in the Model component.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Might limit the relationship between the rooms and their costs.

==== AddService Command

The command is also a Hotel Initialization feature and hence covered above in <<Initialization-AddService>>.

==== ChargeService Command

This section goes through the implementation and design considerations of the ChargeService command.

===== Implementation

The following steps show how the command is implemented:

1.  The command from the user is parsed and undergoes checks for the validity of the given `PERSONID`, `ROOMNUMBER` and `SERVICEID`.
2.  If the parameters are valid, `ChargeServiceCommand#execute(Model model)` is invoked, which checks if the given guest, room and service exists.
3.  If they exist, `Model#chargeService(RoomId roomId, AvailableService service)` is called which in following calls `BookKeeper#chargeServiceToBill(RoomId roomId, AvailableService service)`.
4.  D

image::RemoveChargedServiceSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

Below describes ideas that were considered when designing the command.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
