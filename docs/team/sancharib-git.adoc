== PROJECT: Morpheus

---

== Overview

Morpheus is a hotel management system desktop application designed to manage the activities in a hotel. The user interacts with it in a CLI and it has a GUI created with JavaFx. It is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Set up the *storage architecture for the Hotel* and implemented storage for **rooms and bookings**
** What it does: Allows the app to read and write room and booking details to hotel storage upon exit.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because room and booking data of a hotel must be saved in a database to facilitate hotel management.
** Highlights: This implementation affected commands added in the future as initialization commands have to modify data in the storage. It required in depth analysis of the design of the storage component.
* *Major enhancement*: Set up the *display of the various lists* in the UI i.e. Room list, Booking list, Stay List
** What it does: Allows users to view the rooms, bookings and stays in the hotel.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as the users need to be able to see the current state of the hotel in the UI before entering any commands.
** Highlights: This implementation affected commands added in the future because users need to be able to view these lists first before executing commands on them.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a reserve command that allows the user to make reservations for a guest.
* *Minor enhancement*: updated and modified the user interface to make it personalized to Morpheus.
