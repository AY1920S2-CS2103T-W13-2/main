== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to show and switch between tabs*
** What it does: allows the user to quickly navigate between tabs.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user need to work with multiple type of data and the app should provide a convenient way to traverse between them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as existed implementation only accounted for 1 tab.

* *Minor enhancement*: modify old search command to accommodate new needs.
* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=tanphatls987&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-02-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=false[Functional code]]
